### Summary

This is a promotional site for an English tutor based in London. 

The project is based on the [html5 boilerplate template](https://html5boilerplate.com/), and it built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### To run

After cloning this github repo, simply `cd` into the project on your machine, and then run `npm install`.

I'm using Gulp task runner - if you run `gulp` then BrowserSync will load a mini web server which will refresh automatically when you update a html, SASS or JS file.
